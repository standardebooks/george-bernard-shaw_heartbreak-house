			<p>In the garden, <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Hector</b>, as he comes out through the glass door of the poop, finds <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Lady Utterword</b> lying voluptuously in the hammock on the east side of the flagstaff, in the circle of light cast by the electric arc, which is like a moon in its opal globe. Beneath the head of the hammock, a campstool. On the other side of the flagstaff, on the long garden seat, <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Captain Shotover</b> is asleep, with <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Ellie</b> beside him, leaning affectionately against him on his right hand. On his left is a deck chair. Behind them in the gloom, <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Hesione</b> is strolling about with <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Mangan</b>. It is a fine still night, moonless.</p>

That the stables are the real centre of the household; and that if any visitor wants to play the piano the whole room has to be upset before it can be opened, there are so many things piled on it. I never lived until I learned to ride; and I shall never ride really well because I didn’t begin as a child. There are only two classes in good society in England: the equestrian classes and the neurotic classes.
